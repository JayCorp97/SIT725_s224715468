<h2>Recipe Management System Testing Project</h2>

<strong>Overview</strong>

This is a small Express.js project designed to demonstrate backend testing using Mocha and Chai.
It includes:

A REST API endpoint (GET /api/recipes/count) that returns the total number of recipes.

A calculation function (calculateTotalCookingTime) that sums the cooking times of recipes.

Automated tests covering valid behaviour, invalid inputs, and edge cases.

This project aligns with the SIT725 6.2C assessment requirements.
